This is a WordPress post types plugin for videos posted to external social networking sites.

== Description ==

This plugin creates a new WordPress post type called "External Videos" and aggregates videos from a external social networking site's user channel to the WordPress instance. For example, it finds all the videos of the user "Fred" on YouTube and adds them each as a new post type. The videos can be presented in a gallery using the shortcode [external-videos]. There is also a widget to add a list of the most recent videos in a sidebar.

While some aspects of this plugin do work on wordpress 2.9.2 it is
really designed for 3.0+. When using 2.9 you will miss the following
features:

* Admin Interface to list videos
* Video page per video
* Adding videos as attachments to posts


== Installation ==

To install the External Videos plugin simply:

1. Unpack the downloaded zipped file
2. Upload the "external-videos" folder to your /wp-content/plugins directory
3. Log into Wordpress
4. Go to the "Plugins" page
5. Activate the External Videos Plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What sites are supported? =

Currently supported sites are: YouTube, Vimeo, DotSub

= How do I register another user account to draw videos from? =

Go into the admin interface and add the site and user name. For Vimeo you will also have to add a developer key, which you can get from http://vimeo.com/api/docs/getting-started .

= How often does the plugin pull videos from the registered publishers? =

When you register a external video publisher (e.g. a YouTube user), you should hit the button "add new videos from channels" to extract all existing videos. A daily "cron" job then pulls in any newly posted videos from the last 24 hours. If that is not fast enough for you, you can of course always hit that button again.

If you have problems with "cron", consider installing the "Core Control" plugin, which shows you in Tools -> Core Control -> Cron Tasks tab which tasks you have scheduled.

= How do you do the embedding? =

We use OEmbed. For DotSub we use the service of embed.ly.

= What short codes are available? =

The general shortcode is [external-videos], which creates a video gallery.

You can also now specify [external-videos feature="embed"] to get just the latest video as a featured video and with all its embedding code.

You can further specify [external-videos width="300" height="200"] if you want to change the width and the height of the embedded video.

And you can specify [external-videos link="page"] if you want to get the links on the video gallery to link straight through to the video pages instead of providing an overlay.

= How can I get a RSS feed URL for the external videos? =

Just add the following to your Website URL: ?feed=rss2&post_type=external-videos .
You can add a link like this to your theme layout.
