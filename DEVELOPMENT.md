# Development Instructions

You can quickly bring up an development environment using docker.

First make sure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/linux/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

Then simply
``` bash
docker-compose up
```

You can then browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and edit
your files locally.
